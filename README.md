# EwiData
Database Program to help in transoprt companies


If you want to play with it, just download EwiData.rar, decompress and have fun.
But you need to have mysql installed.
First time you run it, you will need to open Ustawienia in Menu and write down your mysql settings.
It will create preferencesFile.txt and w=you will be able to run app.
Have fun and remember to tell me if you downloaded and tried.
Any comments will be good to.
